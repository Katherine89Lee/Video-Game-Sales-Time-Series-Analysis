# Video Game Sales Time Series Analysis
 An analysis on the sales of video games from the 80s through the 00's. and 10's. 
 
 This started as a basic time series analysis of the game sales across time, but it's turning out that there are a lot of 0.01 and 0.00 entries that are skewing the analyses at the moment.
 
 Currently looking for a solution, but at the moment I've only cleaned up null values.
